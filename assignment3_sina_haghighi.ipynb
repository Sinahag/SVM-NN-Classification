    "Neural Network. Train a neural network using the images from fer2013.csv using Keras. Your first layer should be a Conv2D layer, and the last layers should be a Dense layer followed by a Softmax. Use the Training set for training, PublicTest validation set to avoid overfitting, and the PrivateTest test set for testing. Aim for a minimum validation accuracy of 40% on the Fer2013 validation set. To enhance your model's performance, experiment with various batch sizes and epochs. Incorporate dropout and normalization techniques to further mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. Report precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, and create a confusion matrix on the test set.\n",
